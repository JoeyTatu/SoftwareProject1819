# Social Modifications - Objectives from Project Proposal
# 
# The objective of this project is to create a social networking web application. An Android application (app) is expected to
# be created with the same information as the web application.
#
# A database will be created with all the users’ profiles. This will be encrypted so the information is not public, and that
# only the website and app can view it.
#
# Posts from users’ will also be available where they can upload text and media to their profile. This is similar to the likes
# of Facebook and Instagram. There will also be a chat room and a messaging service for the members.
# 
# Being a social media site, the website will be targeted to people over the age of 18.
# Along with this, there will be chat bot that will be built from scratch. The chat bot will be able to assist users in
# information on the likes of tattoo and piercing aftercare, or with help on the website/app. Also, because people who are
# heavily modified often get abuse that could affect their mental health, the chat bot will also be able to assist the user
# in getting mental health treatment if they so wish to do so, or to simply be an upbeat, positive “person” to talk to.
# 
# The website will also learn what the user likes and dislikes and will show suggested connections based on this.
# The standard Web design coding such as HTML, CSS, XML, will be used along with SQL and Ruby on Rails.
# Node.js and Python will be used to create the chat bot.
